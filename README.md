# Number-Plate-recognition-using-Matlab

Developed and Implemented an algorithm for Vehicle Number plate detection using Image processing Techniques and MATLAB. In this algorithm, alphanumeric characters were from a number plate using various steps. Firstly the given image was converted in to gray and performed 
dilation on it. Afterwards Edges were processed in Horizontal and Vertical direction and passed histograms through low pass filter. The image was then segmented and region of interest was extracted. 
The extracted Region of Interest was converted to Binary and each individual characters were extracted and stored in a file.
